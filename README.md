#Overview

Bobby is an Sbt plugin that prevents outdated dependencies from being used by your project.

#Background
It can be hard to ensure that distributed teams upgrade to the latest version of a dependency. 
This is a problem when there are security fixes or other reasons to require a library to be upgraded. 

Bobby provides the capability to fail builds which have outdated dependencies. 
Ideally communications will be in place to ensure updates happen but Bobby acts as a safety net of last resort.

Bobby also checks your projects' dependency versions against the latest available.
If a newer one is available it suggests to use it without failing the build.
The current version looks into nexus for this, using what is defined in ~/.sbt/.credentials. 
If undefined it skips this step

#How To Use

In your `~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/build.sbt`, set:
```scala
addSbtPlugin("uk.gov.hmrc" % "sbt-bobby" % "<INSERT VERSION>")
```

#### Outdated Dependencies

To prevent outdated dependencies from being used by your project, create a blacklist of version ranges. 
For example:

```json
[
{ "organisation" : "uk.gov.hmrc", "name" : "my-library", "range" : "(,6.0.0)", "reason" : "Versions older than 6.0.0 have a security vulnerability", "from" : "2015-03-15" },
{ "organisation" : "uk.gov.hmrc", "name" : "my-other-library", "range" : "[1.2.0]", "reason" : "1.2.0 has a bug", "from" : "2015-03-15" }
{ "organisation" : "*", "name" : "*", "range" : "[*-SNAPSHOT]", "reason" : "You shouldn't be deploying a snapshot to production should you?", "from" : "2000-01-01" }
]
```

Tell Bobby where to find the file containing the list by setting a `deprecated-dependencies` property in `~/.sbt/bobby.conf`. Bobby can read both local or remote files:

```properties
deprecated-dependencies = https://some-url/deprecated-dependencies.json
deprecated-dependencies = file:///~/.sbt/deprecated-dependencies.json
```


###### Blacklist:
The blacklist must be a json with a list of rows where:
* _organisation_ and _name_ identify the dependency. You can use '*' as wildcard
* _range_ is used to declare minimum, maximum allowed versions of a dependency (both min and max may be optional), and allow "holes" for known incompatible versions. See 'Supported Version Ranges' for more details
* _reason_ tells why the versions in range are deprecated
* _from_ tells when the versions in range become unsupported. The builds will fail after that day. Before only a warning is shown.


###### Supported Version Ranges
| Range          | Meaning                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| (,1.0.0]       | x <= 1.0.0                            |
| [1.0.0]        | Hard requirement on 1.0.0             |
| [1.2.0,1.3.0]  | 1.2.0 <= x <= 1.3.0                   |
| [1.0.0,2.0.0)  | 1.0.0 <= x < 2.0.0                    |
| [1.5.0,)       | x >= 1.5.0                            |
| [*-SNAPSHOT]   | Any version with qualifier 'SNAPSHOT' |


###### JSON output file
Bobby can be configured to output results to a structured JSON file. To enable this feature provide an output filepath using the 
optional output-file parameter in your ~/.sbt/bobby.conf file. The file path could be relative or absolute.

```properties
output-file = bobby-output.json
```
